These dogs have been bred for herding and with their short stature they are able to duck between cows and sheep to avoid being kicked or trampled. The color most associated with Pembroke Welsh Corgi fur is red. This is the most dominant corgi color and is often mixed with a white belly/paw/leg markings.</p>
