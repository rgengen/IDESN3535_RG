    The corgi first appeared in popular culture as Queen Elizabeth the 2nd's favorite dog breed. .
    It wasn't until the past few years with the rise of internet fame that the bred became more main stream and popular. This is due to the corgi's adorable shape and hiliarious personality.
    Both have contributed to the bred's growing popularity. Corgis' all possess the genetic traits of dwarfism leading to a long body and stout legs. They also have foxy shaped heads, wide smiles, and fluffy butts. 
    Despite the expectations associated with such short legs they are also extremely agile and can turn 360 while running at full speeds. This is due to their herding capabilites. Also related to 
    their herding origins is their large personality. Corgis are very vocal often using their voice to let you know what they want. They are also mostly a happy going bred and if socialized correctly extremely friendly. 
    They have to boss around animals many pounds heavy then them so they are sassy and very expressive.
