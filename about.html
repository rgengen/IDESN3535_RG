<p class="text1">The word corgi supposeedly comes from Celtic and translates to "Dwarf Dog"
  Though their origins are obscure and untraceable it is believed that they were around as early as the 10th century. Either bred from the Swedish Vallhunds that were possibly brought by early Vikings or the ancestors of present day Schipperkes and Pomeranians brought by the Flemish. They have grown in popularity due to their adorable bodies and personalities as well as due to internet fame.
